# Data sources

Mapzen Terrain Tiles are powered by several major open data sets and we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the individuals and communities which produced them.

**Attribution is required** for some data providers. See the [Attribution](https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/blob/master/docs/attribution.md) document for more information.

### Footprints database

These source images are composited to form tiles that make up the Mapzen Terrain Tiles service. To determine exactly which images contributed to Mapzen Terrain Tiles in a particular area, you can download the footprints database and use it with a GIS program like [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) to inspect which of these sources were used.

![Preview Rendering of Footprints](images/footprints-preview.png)

* [GeoJSON](https://s3.amazonaws.com/elevation-tiles-prod/docs/footprints.geojson.gz) (8.7MB, gzipped)
* [PostgreSQL Dump](https://s3.amazonaws.com/elevation-tiles-prod/docs/footprints.pgdump.gz) (14.5MB, gzipped)

### Source headers

To further assist in determining which sources contributed to an individual tile, the Mapzen Terrain Tiles service will respond with an [HTTP header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Response_fields) listing the sources that contributed to that tile. The value of the `X-Imagery-Sources` HTTP header is a comma-separated list, where each entry follows the pattern `source/filename.tif`.

For example, a tile might have the header `X-Imagery-Sources: srtm/N39W110.tif, srtm/N39W112.tif, gmted/30N120W_20101117_gmted_mea075.tif`, meaning that it was built from three source images. Two SRTM images and a GMTED image were composited together to generate the tile output. Using the footprint database dumps above you can gather more information about these source images, including the calculated resolution and footprint geometry. To find the entry in the database, look for an entry that has a matching `filename` attribute.


## What is the ground resolution?

Ground resolution per tile pixel varies per zoom level, the given pixel cell's latitude, and input data source.

This formula generates the following table:

`ground_resolution = (cos(latitude * pi/180) * 2 * pi * 6378137 meters) / (256 * 2^zoom_level pixels)`

Ground resolution per **zoom** in `meters` at a given _latitude_:

zoom   | _0°_       | _45°_      | _60°_
------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------
**0**  | `156543.0` | `110692.6` | `78271.5`
**1**  | `78271.5`  | `55346.3`  | `39135.8`
**2**  | `39135.8`  | `27673.2`  | `19567.9`
**3**  | `19567.9`  | `13836.6`  | `9783.9`
**4**  | `9783.9`   | `6918.3`   | `4892.0`
**5**  | `4892.0`   | `3459.1`   | `2446.0`
**6**  | `2446.0`   | `1729.6`   | `1223.0`
**7**  | `1223.0`   | `864.8`    | `611.5`
**8**  | `611.5`    | `432.4`    | `305.7`
**9**  | `305.7`    | `216.2`    | `152.9`
**10** | `152.9`    | `108.1`    | `76.4`
**11** | `76.4`     | `54.0`     | `38.2`
**12** | `38.2`     | `27.0`     | `19.1`
**13** | `19.1`     | `13.5`     | `9.6`
**14** | `9.6`      | `6.8`      | `4.8`
**15** | `4.8`      | `3.4`      | `2.4`

**Note:** Esri has [documentation](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2009/03/19/how-can-you-tell-what-map-scales-are-shown-for-online-maps/) about converting web map zoom integers to conventional map scales.

## What is sourced at what zooms?

Generally speaking, **GMTED** is used at low-zooms, **ETOPO1** is used to show ocean bathymetry at all zooms (even bathymetry oversampled at zoom 15), and **[SRTM](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/)** is relied on in mid- and high-zooms on land. Some countries have higher resolution data available over land sourced from other open datasets. More information about these sources is available below.

It should be noted that both `SRTM` and `GMTED` fill oceans and other bodies of water with a value of zero to indicate mean sea level; in these areas, `ETOPO1` provides bathymetry (as well as in regions which are not covered by `SRTM` and `GMTED`).

**Data sources per zoom:**

**0**  | `ETOPO1` | `ETOPO1`

## Sources native resolution

You might be wondering why we source from different data sets at different zooms. Besides bandwidth reasons, it's helpful to know the native resolution of each data set which is expressed as a nominal arc resolution which maps roughly to a web map zoom for "best displayed at".

In more practical terms, this results in some datasets being **"oversampled"** for a given zoom and map location.

* In the water, most bathymetry values at zoom 15 for a pixel that has a ground resolution of 5 meter will actually be showing an oversampled zoom 6 `ETOPO1` value (nominally 2.5 km).

* On the land, most elevation values at zoom 15 for a pixel that has a ground resolution of 5 meter will actually be showing an oversampled zoom 12 `SRTM` value (nominally 30 meters).

This formula generates the following table:

`ground_resolution = (cos(latitude * pi/180) * 2 * pi * 6378137 meters) / (256 * 2^zoom_level pixels) / 30.87 meters per arc second`

Arc resolution per **zoom** and data sources, per pixel:

zoom   | meters at equator     | arc seconds     | nominal arc degrees minutes seconds            | source      | nominal ground units

## Data updates

Terrain tiles version 1 was built during 2016Q2 and released in 2016Q3 based on available sources at that time. Version 1.1 was built during 2017Q3 and released 2017Q4. Regular updates are not planned.

Future updates will be on an as-needed basis for smaller regions to incorporate additional `3DEP` coverage in the United States and additional country specific data sources globally.

We are always looking for better datasets. If you find a data issue or can suggest an open terrain datasets, please let us know by filing an issue in [tilezen/joerd](https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/issues/new).

## Known issues

Many classical DEM and LIDAR related issues occur in terrain tiles. It is not uncommon to see large variations in elevation in areas with large buildings and other such structures. Resampling and merging artifacts are also observed along coastlines (where different datasets are seamed together).
